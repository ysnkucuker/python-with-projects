# Python with Projects 🐍

This repository is designed to teach Python from scratch using hands-on projects.
Each **project** contains a standalone Python project that focuses on specific concepts,
from basics to more advanced topics.

## Repository Structure

Each project in this repository represents a **single Python project**.
